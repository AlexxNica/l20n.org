<p>This is an entity called <code>hello</code>. Entities are containers for information. You use entities to identify, store, and recall information to be used in the software's UI.</p>
<p>&lt;hello "Hello, World!"&gt;</p>
<p>In its simplest form, an entity stores a value; here it's a string, <code>Hello, World!</code>.  Most of the entities you will work with in L20n will look similar to  this.  Some will be more complex, have more than one value variant, or use expressions to select the right variant depending on the circumstances.</p>
