  <div class="left">
    <p>In the Firefox download panel, a string like this shows up while downloading file: <code>4 hours, 1 minute and 26 seconds remaining</code>.</p>
    <p>It contains three units, all of which can be in any of the plural forms, available in the target language.</p>
    <p>Languages handle plurals of nouns or unit expressions very differently. Some have only one form; some have two, like English; and some have multiple forms. Slovenian, for example, has <a href="http://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/latest/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html#sl">four</a>.</p>
    <p>It sounds complex enough to use it as an example.</p>
    <p>First, we need to define the plural macro that will return one of the four plural forms, based on the input argument (number).</p>
    <p>Next, for each of the units (hours, minutes, and seconds), we provide a dictionary with plural forms as keys and translations of units in appropriate plural forms as values.</p>
    <p>And finally, we join the numbers and units in the complete string.</p>
